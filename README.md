# MacCheck-2.0
Inspired by General -HeX-'s SkidCheck 2.0, except it kicks all users connecting via a MAC. Because fuck MACs.

# If you use a MAC
Tough shit <3 Get a real PC

# If you want to one day afford a MAC
Stop being an idiot and just stick with PC

# If you use linux
You are doing gods work <3
